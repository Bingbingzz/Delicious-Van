## Project description
  Introducing our innovative food review app! With two main functions, Restaurants and Explore, this app provides an easy and convenient way to share your thoughts and opinions on your dining experiences.

  With the Restaurants function, you can access a comprehensive database of registered restaurants, complete with menu information, address, and phone numbers. You can write reviews and provide ratings, which will be displayed in the restaurant's review section for other users to read and consider.

  The Explore function is perfect for discovering new places to dine. Here, you can share reviews and ratings for restaurants that are not yet registered in our app. Other users can view these reviews in the Explore section, helping them make informed decisions about where to eat.

  Our app is designed with user experience in mind, providing a simple and intuitive interface that is easy to use. With just a few taps, you can find restaurant information, read reviews, and even post your own food experience.

  If you're a foodie who loves to explore new places and share your experiences with others, this app is for you! Download it today and start discovering the best dining spots in town.
